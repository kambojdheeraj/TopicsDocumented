1) Docker - Docker is container based technology and containers are just user space of the operating system. 
A Virtual Machine, on the other hand, is not based on container technology. They are made up of user space plus kernel space of an operating system. Under VMs, server hardware is virtualized.

Purpose of Docker: Its primary focus is to automate the deployment of applications inside software containers and the automation of operating system level virtualization on Linux. It's more lightweight than standard Containers and boots up in seconds.

A fundamental difference between Kubernetes and Docker is that Kubernetes is meant to run across a cluster while Docker runs on a single node. Kubernetes is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner.

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.[6] Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[7] Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.[8]
